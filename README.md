# Decompiler
## Overview
This program works to decompile to ANSI C from x86 assembly based on an LLVM compilation. I may choose to add functionality to go from machine code in the future but currently do not plan too. I am interested in reverse engineering and at one point took a class on language design which gave me some familiarity with parsing. Given that I thought this would be a fun project. 

## Status
This contains a checklist for what exists in the current iteration. This list is subject to change as I learn more about decompilation.
1. Make it work
	- [ ] arithmetic
		- [ ] addition/subtraction
		- [ ] multiplication/division
		- [ ] modulo
		- [ ] increment
		- [ ] decrement
  	- [ ] comparison
   		- [ ] equal
     		- [ ] greater/less than or equal to
	- [ ] variable declaration
		- [ ] types
		- [ ] ptr's
	- [ ] logic
		- [ ] if/then/else
		- [ ] and
		- [ ] or
	- [ ] loops
		- [ ] while
		- [ ] for
	- [ ] printing
	- [ ] functions
2. Optimization
	- [ ] benchmarks
	- [ ] comparison
